a deck is just an array of card objects
    - valid decks must be exactly 20 cards
    - to shuffle deck: use .map to put each card object in its own object:
        {card: cardObj, sort: Math.random()}
      then, use .sort to sort the keys, and a final .map call to strip the
      card out of the object

cardObject = {
    name: string,
    portrait: string (url),

    element: an ELEMENT_ constant,
    currentHP: number,
    maxHP: number,
    attack: number,
    manaCost: number,

    isRanged: bool,
    isQuick: bool,
    isMaster: bool,
    
    hasSkill: bool,
    skillReady: bool,
    skill: not sure yet -- maybe some kind of string or numerical identifier?,
    hasPassive: bool,
    passive: again, not sure how exactly to implement yet
}
